<p><em>NOTICE</em>: This is the public GitHub repository for an EXPERIMENTAL version of the USGS Soil-Water-Balance model.
Code found here is under development and IS NOT be suitable for
project work. The official version of the code may be found at:
<a href="http://wi.water.usgs.gov/Soil_Water_Balance/">http://wi.water.usgs.gov/Soil_Water_Balance/</a>.</p>

<p>The Soil-Water-Balance (SWB) computer code has been developed to calculate spatial and temporal
 variations in groundwater recharge. The SWB model calculates recharge by use of commonly available 
 geographic information system (GIS) data layers in combination with tabular climatological data.
The code is based on a modified Thornthwaite-Mather soil-water-balance approach, with 
components of the soil-water balance calculated at a daily timestep. 
Recharge calculations are made on a rectangular grid of computational elements that may be 
easily imported into a regional groundwater-flow model. Recharge estimates calculated by
 the code may be output as daily, monthly, or annual values.</p>

<p>The experimental version in this repository incorporates some of the latest Fortran 2003/2008 features. This
 version is an INCOMPLETE WORK IN PROGRESS.</p>
