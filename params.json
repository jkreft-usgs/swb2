{"name":"Swb2","tagline":"Development version of SWB","body":"SWB2 - [EXPERIMENTAL] A Modified Thornthwaite-Mather Soil-Water-Balance Code for Estimating Groundwater Recharge\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n*NOTICE*: This is the public GitHub repository for an EXPERIMENTAL version of the USGS Soil-Water-Balance model.\r\nCode found here is under development and IS NOT be suitable for\r\nproject work. The official version of the code may be found at:\r\n<http://wi.water.usgs.gov/Soil_Water_Balance/>.\r\n\r\nThe Soil-Water-Balance (SWB) computer code has been developed to calculate spatial and temporal\r\n variations in groundwater recharge. The SWB model calculates recharge by use of commonly available \r\n geographic information system (GIS) data layers in combination with tabular climatological data.\r\nThe code is based on a modified Thornthwaite-Mather soil-water-balance approach, with \r\ncomponents of the soil-water balance calculated at a daily timestep. \r\nRecharge calculations are made on a rectangular grid of computational elements that may be \r\neasily imported into a regional groundwater-flow model. Recharge estimates calculated by\r\n the code may be output as daily, monthly, or annual values.\r\n \r\nThe experimental version in this repository incorporates some of the latest Fortran 2003/2008 features. This\r\n version is an INCOMPLETE WORK IN PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftware User Rights Notice\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nSoftware and related material (data and (or) documentation), contained in\r\n or furnished in connection with a software distribution, are made available\r\n by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to be used in the public\r\n interest and in the advancement of science.
