# Soil-Water-Balance Model: output variable descriptions {#variable_descriptions}

SWB keeps track of 30 state and internal variables for use during a simulation. If desired, some or all of these variables may be extracted on a daily, monthly, or annual basis. Output is controlled by means of the control file directive `OUTPUT_OPTIONS`. The variables currently defined in SWB are given in the table below.

Variable name            | Description                     | Units  |Detail
-------------------------|---------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------
GROSS_PRECIP             | Gross precipitation             | inches | Liquid precipitation as supplied to the model via grid or table values, before any transformative processes have been considered (i.e. interception, snowfall).
SNOWMELT                 | Snowmelt                        | inches | Water generated by the melting of `SNOWCOVER`.
INFLOW                   | Inflow from upslope cell        | inches | Water generated by means of overland flow, transported from an adjacent upslope cell.                
NET_IRRIGATION_AMOUNT    | TOTAL irrigation demand         | inches | Sum of irrigation amount from both groundwater and surface water sources.
SNOWFALL                 | Precipitation falling as snow   | inches | Amount of precipitation converted to snow given daily minimum and maximum air temperatures.
INTERCEPTION             | Interception (rain/snow)        | inches | Amount of gross precipitation intercepted by vegetation.
OUTFLOW                  | Outflow to a downslope cell     | inches | Water generated by means of overland flow or rejected recharge, transported to an adjacent downslope cell.
