# Scope and Purpose {#scope}

This report documents the Soil-Water Balance (SWB) computer code, which is designed to calculate the spatial distribution of groundwater recharge over time using a gridded data structure. The SWB model should yield better results than can be obtained by assuming that a fraction of precipitation converts to recharge; conversely, the SWB model is much simpler and less time-intensive to apply than a fully coupled groundwater and surface-water model \citep{markstrom_gsflowcoupled_2008}  (Markstrom and others, 2008; Jyrkama and others, 2002) [need to add this ref to the database].

The theoretical basis, data requirements for use, and limitations and assumptions relating to the SWB code are presented in this report. The requirements for application of the SWB code, including the directory structure and input files, the types of output available, and the various control-file options are described. In addition, two test cases are provided. The first test case (Black Earth Creek) confirms the numerical accuracy of the SWB code relative to the original Visual Basic code on which it is based. The second test case demonstrates the application of the SWB code to a large model domain (Lake Michigan Basin, with a drainage area of approximately 45,600 \sqmi).
