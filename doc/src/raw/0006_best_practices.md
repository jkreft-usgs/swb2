# Best Practices {#best_practices}

The Soil-Water-Balance code has been applied to dozens of sites around the world since its initial release [@westenbroek_swbmodified_2010]. In this section we attempt to summarize a set of best practices for application of the SWB model. These best practices really amount to what any good modeler would do when applying a modeling framework in a new environmental setting:

1. Begin with reasonable parameter values--be wary of recycling parameter values left over from previous studies.
2. Compare SWB output to other applicable regional and point estimates of potential recharge.
