### Impervious surface runoff_routing

Runoff from impervious surfaces may be simulated in a more detailed manner by including a gridded dataset defining the proportion of each gridcell that is comprised of impervious materials. Data may be supplied as either a fraction (0.0-1.0) or percentage (0-100%) of either pervious or *im*pervious surface area.
