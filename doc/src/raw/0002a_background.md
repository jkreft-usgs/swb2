Groundwater recharge can vary greatly over time and space. Site-specific data, when available, are not applicable to regional-scale problems. Groundwater modelers often assume that a fraction of precipitation is converted to recharge, or they instead use recharge as a calibration parameter. In transient groundwater-modeling problems, use of a physically based, spatially variable recharge boundary condition has been found to improve model performance [@jyrkama_impact_2007].

Numerical modeling is one technique sometimes used to supply a spatially varied, transient recharge boundary condition on a regional scale [@scanlon_choosing_2002]. Simple soil-water-balance models are a category of numerical models commonly applied to groundwater recharge estimation problems. There perhaps are hundreds of soil-water-balance models described in the literature. Many soil-water-balance models were developed in order to evaluate crop irrigation requirements and impacts [@kendy_soil_water_balance_2003], crop yield prediction [@akinremi_simulation_1996], and landfill cover design [@schroeder_hydrologic_1994].

Similarly, there are many examples of groundwater recharge estimation by means of a soil-water-balance. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) HELP model, a soil-water-balance code used in landfill design [@schroeder_hydrologic_1994], has been linked to commercial geographic information system (GIS) software [@jyrkama_impact_2007]. WetSpass calculates long-term recharge by means of a soil-water-balance model within a commercial GIS software package [@batelaan_wetspass_2001].  [@finch_estimating_2001] describes a distributed daily soil-water-balance model, but does not specify the computing platform.

The SWB code described in this report was derived from work completed as part of a doctoral dissertation at the University of Wisconsin-Madison [@dripps_spatial_2003; @dripps_simple_2007]. This code was written in Visual Basic for Applications inside of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet [@dripps_spatial_2003]. 

Each of the examples listed above either requires proprietary software, is implemented in a proprietary language, is complex to set up and use, or is not distributed in the public domain. For these reasons, in 2006, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) translated the original soil-water-balance code from Visual Basic to modern Fortran 95.
