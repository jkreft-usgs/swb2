**APWL:** *Accumulated Potential Water Loss.* Represents the running sum of unmet potential evapotranspiration ($P - PE$) over days for which evapotranspiration is greater than precipitation. On days where the precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration, the positive value of $P - PE$ is 7added to the previous day's soil moisture to calculate the current day's soil moisture; the soil moisture retention tables [@thornthwaite_instructions_1957] can then be used to back-calculate a new APWL value for ongoing calculations.
