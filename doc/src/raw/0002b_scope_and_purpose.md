# Scope and Purpose {#scope}

This report documents the Soil-Water Balance (SWB) computer code, which is designed to calculate the spatial distribution of groundwater recharge over time using a gridded data structure. The SWB model should yield better results than can be obtained by assuming that a fraction of precipitation converts to recharge; conversely, the SWB model is much simpler and less time-intensive to apply than a fully coupled groundwater and surface-water model [@markstrom_gsflowcoupled_2008; @jyrkama_recharge_2002].

The theoretical basis, data requirements for use, and limitations and assumptions relating to the SWB code are presented in this report. In addition, two test cases are provided. The first test case (Maui, Hawaii) confirms the performance of the SWB code relative to the Hawaii Water Budget code. The second test case demonstrates the application of the SWB code to the Little Plover River in Wisconsin.

Appendixes to this document contain a complete listing of control file directives and a description of input and output files use with SWB.
